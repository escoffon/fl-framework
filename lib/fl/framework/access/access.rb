module Fl::Framework::Access
  # Access control APIs.
  # This module adds support for access control to a class.
  # When it is included, it defines the macro {ClassMacros#has_access_control}, which turns on access
  # control support in the class.
  # When access control is enabled, a number of instance and class methods are registered; see the
  # documentation for {ClassMethods} and {InstanceMethods}.
  #
  # The methods in this module define and implement a framework for standardizing access control
  # management, but don't provide a specific access control algorithm, and don't enforce access
  # control at the record level. (That functionality is left to a higher level layer, typically in a
  # service object.
  # Classes define the access check strategy by providing an instance of (a subclass of)
  # {Fl::Framework::Access::AccessChecker} to {ClassMacros#has_access_control}.
  #
  # The APIs use a generic object called an *actor* as the entity that requests permission to perform
  # a given operation on an object. The type of *actor* is left undefined, and it is expected that
  # clients of this framework will provide their own specific types. Typically, this will be some kind of
  # user object, but it may be a software agent as well. The framework mostly passes the actor parameter
  # down to the access checkers that implement the specialized access control algorithms; these checkers
  # should be aware of the nature of the actor entity.
  #
  # The access package also defines a number of standard permissions; see the documentation for the
  # {Permission} class.
  #
  # To enable access control, define an access checker subclass and pass it to
  # {ClassMacros#has_access_control}:
  #
  # ```
  # class MyAccessChecker < Fl::Framework::Access::Checker
  #   def access_check(permission, actor, asset, context = nil)
  #     # here is the access check code
  #   end
  # end
  #
  # class MyDatum < ActiveRecord::Base
  #   include Fl::Framework::Access::Access
  #
  #   has_access_control MyAccessChecker.new
  # end
  # ```
  #
  # You can also add acces control to an existing class, using {Helper.add_access_control}:
  #
  # ```
  # class MyAccessChecker < Fl::Framework::Access::Checker
  #   def access_check(permission, actor, asset, context = nil)
  #     # here is the access check code
  #   end
  # end
  #
  # class MyDatum < ActiveRecord::Base
  # end
  #
  # Fl::Framework::Access::Helper.add_access_control(MyDatum, MyAccessChecker.new)
  # ```

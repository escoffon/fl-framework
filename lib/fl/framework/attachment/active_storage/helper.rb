    # hash in the return value.

    # value. If you want to define a custom variant, use the hash format of the element and don't forget

    # **:blob**, which are allowed event though they may not be in the known styles.

    #  A string value is a comma-separated list of style names.
    #  Each element of the array value is either a style name, or a hash containing processing parameters
    #  for a variant.
    #  The symbol `:all` indicates that all supported styles should be returned.

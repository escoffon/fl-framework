      #    - The string 'OR' (we allow for 'or' to be a bit lenient).
      #      We also allow the string '|' to stand for 'OR', so that the Postgres-style operator name is
      #      also supported.
      #    - The string 'AND' (we allow for 'and' to be a bit lenient). This operator is not really needed,
      #      because any words not connected by an operator are connected by '&'.
      #    - The string 'AROUND(n)' (we allow for 'around(n)' to be a bit lenient).
      #      Here `n` is an integer to indicate the distance between the two operands.
      #    - The string '-'.
      # 2. Words; these are collections of characters that drive the matches.
      # 3. Quoted strings; collections of words to be matched as a unit.
      # 4. Grouping: the strings '(' and ')' to control operator precedence.
      #
      # This text query string has the same format as the one used by Google.
      #
      # @param qs [String] A string containing characters and operators.
      #
      # @return [Array<Array>] Returns an array of tokens; the elements are two-element arrays where
      #  the first element is the token type, and the second the token value (if any).
      #  The token types are:
      #
      #  - **:quoted** A quoted string (which typically contains spaces); the value is the quoted string.
      #  - **:word** A word; the value is the word.
      #  - **:minus** The '-' operator.
      #  - **:and** The 'AND' operator.
      #  - **:or** The 'OR' operator.
      #  - **:around** The 'AROUND(n)' operator; the value is the integer value of `n`.
      #  - **:open** The open paren.
      #  - **:close** The close paren.
      #
      # @raise [MalformedQuery] Raises this exception if the tokenizer detects a malformed query string.

module Fl::Framework::Actor
  # Model class for actor groups.
  # An actor group manages a collection of actor objects by managing a collection of group member objects.
  # Any subclass of {ActiveRecord::Base} that wants to be placed in actor groups must call the
  # {Fl::Framework::Actor::Actor::ClassMacros#is_actor} macro:
  #
  # ```
  # class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  #  is_actor
  # end
  # ```
  # (Note that only subclasses of {ActiveRecord::Base} can be actors.)
  #
  # Instances of {Group} manage collections of {Fl::Framework::Actor::GroupMember} objects, which adds
  # a few properties to the relationship, as described in the documentation for
  # {Fl::Framework::Actor::GroupMember}. This is essentially a `has_many_through` association, where the
  # "through" class contains additional information for the relationship.
  #
  # #### Associations
  #
  # The class defines the following associations:
  #
  # - {#owner} is a `belongs_to` association to the entity that "owns" the group.
  # - {#members} is a `has_many` association that lists all the members in the group.
  # - {#groups} is a `has_many` association that lists all the groups to which the group belongs.
  #   This association is actually created implicitly by the
  #   {Fl::Framework::Actor::Actor::ClassMacros#is_actor} macro.

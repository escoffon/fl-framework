module Fl::Framework::Actor
  # A member in an actor group.
  # Instances of this class manage the relationship between an actor and its container group.
  # This creates a layer of indirection between a group and its members that adds these properties
  # to the relationship:
  #
  # - An actor can be placed in multiple lists.
  #
  # #### Associations
  #
  # The class defines the following associations:
  #
  # - {#group} is a `belongs_to` association linking to the container group (an instance of
  #   {Fl::Framework::Actor::Group}).
  #   Note that this is a readonly value: once set in the constructor, the group cannot be changed.
  # - {#actor} is a polymorphic `belongs_to` association linking to the member actor.
  #   Note that this is a readonly value: once set in the constructor, the actor cannot be
  #   changed.

    #
    # Note that any WHERE clauses from *:updated_after*, *:created_after*, *:updated_before*,
    # and *:created_before* are concatenated using the AND operator. The values for these options are:
    # a UNIX timestamp; a Time object; a string containing a representation of the time (this string
    # is converted to a {Fl::Framework::Core::Icalendar::Datetime} internally).

    # @param opts [Hash] A Hash containing configuration options for the query.

    #  value (technically, whose `group_id` attribute is in the list of identifiers derived from the option's
    #  value).
    #  The elements in an array value are {Fl::Framework::Actor::Group} instances, group identifiers, or
    #  object fingerprints (string values are interpreted as fingerprints or object identifier, depending
    #  on their contents).
    #  If this option is not present, all group members are selected.

    #  value).
    #  The elements in an array value are {Fl::Framework::Actor::Group} instances, group identifiers, or
    #  object fingerprints (string values are interpreted as fingerprints or object identifier, depending
    #  on their contents).
    #  If this option is not present, all group members are selected.

    #  members whose `actor` attribute is not in the option's value
    #  (technically, whose `actor_id` and `actor_type` attribute pairs are not in the list
    #  derived from the option's value).
    #  The elements in an array value are object instances or object fingerprints; note that identifiers
    #  are not supported, because the `listed_object` association is polymorphic.
    #  If this option is not present, all group members are selected.
    # @option opts [Integer, Time, String] :updated_after selects list items updated after a given time.
    # @option opts [Integer, Time, String] :created_after selects list items created after a given time.
    # @option opts [Integer, Time, String] :updated_before selects list items updated before a given time.
    # @option opts [Integer, Time, String] :created_before selects list items created before a given time.
    # @option opts [Integer] :offset Sets the number of records to skip before fetching;
    #  a `nil` value causes the option to be ignored.
    #  Defaults to 0 (start at the beginning).
    # @option opts [Integer] :limit The maximum number of records to return;
    #  a `nil` value causes the option to be ignored.
    #  Defaults to all records.
    # @option opts [String, Array] :order A string or array containing the <tt>ORDER BY</tt> clauses
    #  for the records. The string value is converted to an array by splitting it at commas.
    #  A `false` value or an empty string or array causes the option to be ignored.
    #  Defaults to <tt>list_id ASC, sort_order ASC</tt>, so that the records are ordered by sort order
    #  and grouped by list.
    # @option opts [Symbol, Array<Symbol>, Hash] :includes An array of symbols (or a single symbol),
    #  or a hash, to pass to the +includes+ method
    #  of the relation; see the guide on the ActiveRecord query interface about this method.
    #  The value defaults to `[ :group, :actor ]`, so that by default the {#group} and {#actor}
    #  association are eager loaded; we do this because there is a high probability that the caller
    #  will attempt to access either or both objects after the query.
    #
    # Note that *:limit*, *:offset*, and *:includes* are convenience options, since they can be
    # added later by making calls to +limit+, +offset+, and +includes+ respectively, on the
    # return value. But there are situations where the return type is hidden inside an API wrapper, and
    # the only way to trigger these calls is through the configuration options.

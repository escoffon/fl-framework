module Fl::Framework::Actor
  # Extension module that adds support for actor behavior.
  # An actor is an entity that performs operations; the typical example is a user, but software agents
  # could also be actors.

  module Actor
    # Class macros for actor objects.
    # {ClassMacros#is_actor} is used to indicate that instances of the class include actor functionality.
    
    module ClassMacros
      # Add actor behavior to a model.
      # An actor model is used to request permission grants and to define the entity that performs an
      # operation. It can be added to one or more groups, which it tracks through a `has_many`
      # association named **actor_containers**, which is defined in the body of this method.
      # Therefore, if a model is defined like this:
      #
      # ```
      #   class MyActor < ActiveRecord::Base
      #     include Fl::Framework::Actor::Actor
      #
      #     is_actor
      #   end
      # ```
      #
      # then instances of `MyActor` include an association named **actor_containers** (and a number of methods).
      #
      # This method also includes {Fl::Framework::List::Listable::InstanceMethods} in the calling
      # class. Those instance methods assume that the **actor_containers** association is defined (which
      # it will be).
      #
      # @param [Hash] cfg A hash containing configuration parameters.
      # @option cfg [Symbol,String,Proc] :title (:name) The "title" method is used to populate the
      #  **:title** attribute of a group member object if one is not explicitly given.
      #  It is customizable to support a wide range of objects that register as actors.
      #  The value is a symbol or string containing the name of the method called by the
      #  {Fl::Framework::Actor::Actor::InstanceMethods#group_member_title}
      #  method to get the title for the group member.
      #  It can also be a Proc that takes no arguments and returns a string.

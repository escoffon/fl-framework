Description:
  This generator installs the Javascript framework assets into vendor/assets/javascripts.
  Some gems (for example, webpacker) do not support accessing assets outside of the
  directory structure of the Rails application, and therefore you have to copy
  those files over.

Arguments:
  No arguments needed.

Example:
  rails generate fl:framework:js_assets

  The generator will create:
    vendor/assets/javascripts/fl/framework
  as a copy of app/assets/javascript/fl/framework in the gem.

  It will also create a package.json file, or modify an existing one, to register
  Yarn packages used by the Javascript assets.
